Read Me:

We are analyzing conversations that include a main character in the TV show Criminal Minds. As criminology majors, we selected this series as we can both relate to this show sparking an interest in the topic of crime and analysis. 
We used a convenience sample to select two episodes to watch and analyze conversations of. We have a total of 54 observations, 23 from Season 8 Episode 10 titled “The Lesson” and 31 from Season 10 Episode 21 titled “Mr Scratch.” We selected these episodes because they are memorable and entertaining episodes from the entire series. 
When analyzing conversations, we are looking at a variety of different variables. These variables aid in our understanding of how the show’s narratives can impact both the characters of the series as well as the audience and their ideas about crime.

Quantitative Variable 1 - Length_of_Conversation_in_Seconds
The first quantitative variable is, “Length of Conversation in Seconds.” We collected this data by counting the number of seconds that each conversation involving a main character of Criminal Minds lasted. The majority of conversations in each episode do not last more than 1 minute so we chose to measure the length in seconds rather than in minutes. The shortest conversation lasted about 5 seconds while the longest conversation lasted roughly 222 seconds.

Quantitative Variable 2 - Number_of_Humorous_Statements
The next quantitative variable is, “Number of Humorous Statements.” This variable counts the number of humorous statements made in each conversation involving a main character. If a statement is made by a character that makes the audience laugh or the statement has a witty or amusing undertone, it is considered a humorous statement. Many conversations did not contain any humorous statements, however, others had up to 4. We analyzed this variable to see how humor can be used in dark situations and conversations, perhaps as a coping mechanism to deal with the gruesome and frightening crimes that occur.

Quantitative Variable 3 - Number_of_Stats_from_Reid
The final quantitative variable is, “Number of Stats from Reid.” This variable measures a count of the number of factual or statistical statements that Dr. Spencer Reid makes in each conversation involving a main character from the show. A zero marks that either Reid is not present for the conversation or Reid does not make any factual or statistical comments. Many conversations are marked with zeros due to these factors. The most statistical statements that Reid made in a conversation were 3. By analyzing the number of factual statements that Dr. Reid, it makes it possible to instill fear in audiences as it adds a realistic aspect to the fictional series that can be applied to the real world of true crime.

Qualitative Variable 1 - Relation_to_the_Case 
The first qualitative variable is, “Relation_to_the_Case”. We collected the data by seeing if the conversation is directly related to the case that the characters are trying to solve in the episode. On a scale of 1-3, with 1 being directly related to the case, 2 being somewhat related to the case, and 3 being not related to the case. We measured this concept by deciding if the conversations that the characters were having were regarding the case or to their personal lives. 

Qualitative Variable 2 - Audience_Emotion
The second qualitative variable is, “Audience_Emotion”. We collected the data by observing if the audience would have an emotional reaction to a specific conversation that was happening in the episode. On a scale of  0-2, with 0 being not scared/uneasy, 1 being slightly scared/uneasy, and 2 being scared/uneasy. We measured this concept by how we felt while viewing a particular conversation, there are some scenes and conversations that are disturbing to view which would make viewers disturbed/uneasy.

Qualitative Variable 3 - Character_Reaction
The third qualitative variable is, “Character_Reaction”. We collected the data by observing if the characters showed any reaction to the conversation that is being had. On a scale of 0-2, with 0 being character showed no signs of feeling disturbed, 1 being character showed a few signs of feeling disturbed, and 2 being character expressed that they felt disturbed. We measured this concept by observing facial expressions, verbally expressing feeling disturbed, and body language indicating that they were disturbed in a specific conversation.
